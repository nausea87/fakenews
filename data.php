            need to format them better, because they can be be difficult to read. I kind of agree, and I am working on it.
            But now I am watching some video of Gordon Ramsay and I got a bit hungry, eventhough he always hates the food.
            Yeah, whatever. Sweden to nuke Norway I guess. Overkill if you ask me.
